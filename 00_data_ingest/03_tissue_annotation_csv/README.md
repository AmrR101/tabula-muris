# Tissue Annotation CSVs

Note: If you are re-generating the annotations on your own, there are a few important things to be aware of:

1. "Aorta" is a subtissue of "Heart," and thus were double-annotated by both Heart and Aorta tissue specialists, and in some cases conflict. We chose to go with the Aorta-created annotations for these cells.
2. "Diaphragm" is a subtissue of "Muscle," and thus were double-annotated by both Diaphragm and Muscle tissue specialists, and in some cases conflict. We chose to go with the Diaphragm-creatd annotations for these cells
